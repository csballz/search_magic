h1. SearchMagic

SearchMagic provides full-text search capabilities to "mongoid":"github.com/mongoid/mongoid" documents, embedded documents, and referenced documents with a clean, consistent, and easy to use syntax. Searching can be performed on either word fragments, such as @foo@, or can use a selector-syntax, @foo:bar@, to target which fields of the document the search is to be restricted to.

h2. Installation

SearchMagic is built on top of the latest pre-release version of mongoid; in all likelihood, it will only work with versions greater than or equal to @2.0.0.rc.7@. For environments where bundler is being used, it can be installed by adding the following to your Gemfile and running @bundle@.

bc. gem 'search_magic'
